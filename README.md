a set of tests


`npm install`

`npm start`

view the tests in browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444)

get the tests to pass. refer to the tests in the files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see whether it worked.


You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    `npm test`
